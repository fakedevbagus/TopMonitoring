## Security Considerations

### Data Handling
- Top Monitoring only monitors system hardware metrics
- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- Settings are stored locally on the user's machine

### Dependencies
- The application uses LibreHardwareMonitor for hardware monitoring
- Ensure you download dependencies from official sources
- Keep your .NET runtime updated

### Best Practices
- Run the application with appropriate user permissions
- Do not run untrusted executables alongside the monitoring tool
- Regularly update your system and dependencies

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying user data
- Respect the privacy of other users

We will credit you (if desired) once the issue is resolved.
